// expression ordering the snaks of one occurrence. With s.RefOrder the
// occurrence's row of reference_snak_order (perm: reference_snak ordinals in
// the occurrence's order) is looked up by primary key (LATERAL with OFFSET 0,
// one lookup per occurrence) and a snak goes at its place in perm, at its
// ordinal when the occurrence has no row (its order is reference_snak's).
// Without it the snaks go by ordinal.
